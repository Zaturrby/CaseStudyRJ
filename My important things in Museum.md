# List of important things

- Something that connects with my thoughts, current or otherwise engaging. Generally it's just another place to think for me. Like the open spaces like the park, library or even a cafe. But one of quite a different nature.

This is very much linked to your education, Art History, and this study too, really helps me to see things. If your only thought in a museum is "I like pie", the only place you're going to connect with is the restaurant. But if you look at a work of art and the thought "hey, this is a genre piece, with probably several layers of meaning" pops up, it becomes more interactive.

- Other people.. well yeah. I think at least, I generally go alone. I love it with art history though that you kind of claim a museum when you're there with a big group of people. If you walk alone then you always bump into someone and have a short conversation. You have lots of little conversations. People being like glued to each other, especially couples, annoy me though. 

I also loved seeing people paint and draw in museum, I never saw it in the Rijks, but I saw it several times in museums in NYC. It expands the activities possible in museums. Writing as well.

- Restaurants, or the entrance/coat-area. Some of the best experiences in museums are to be had in the restaurant. Pie for instance. No, but really, it's the place where you're still within the ideals of the museums, yet you seem to forget it. There is no forcing you to do or think something interesting. Yet your thoughts are still filled with the museum, so it flows automatically. Transitional areas or something. The fountain is also good example of this in the Rijks.

- Generally the whole quality and diversity of the collection. The mastery inside its art. Art can teach something, especially well made art, but it doesn't yield it's information easily. Art and even entertainment are more generally a school for social or emotive skills. Yet there is a problem with movies for instance. The speed at which events pass within a film makes reflection rather impossible, and thus application to your own life as well. You still retain a general notion afterward, but the little things which made it great are lost. Art in museums is still, allowing you to examine things like posture, facial expression, composition, etcetera. Yet to notice these things one needs to have those words and meanings readily available. I for sure didn't three years ago. Dependent on education.
