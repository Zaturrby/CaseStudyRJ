# UCS - Robert-Jan

1. In this first photo I couldn't resist taking a picture of the icon in the toilet knowing all that I knew about the UCS at that time. It was the first custom-made element in the Rijksmuseum that drew my attention.
2. Of course the same for the map with the navigation issue in mind.
3. Because I was alone my visit was really biased as I tried to get my head around everything I heard from the project. I was trying to give everything a place. But I remembered that before I knew anything about this project the reactions people had to this particular diamond drew my attention. I myself was attracted to its flicker. I often write my thoughts down in a museum when I'm alone and this was what I did the first time I noticed this. I sat down and waited a bit, unluckily nobody really responded to the diamond like the first time. I suppose my own fascination with it could have stimulated others back then.
5. Couldn't resist taking that photo, I don't know why, it is not that pretty. Its emotive though. Perhaps I took it because it drew a child's interest when I walked past.
7. This picture I took because the area itself drew my attention. The lights were dimmed, which made the objects all the more mysterious.
11. This one in particular I felt to photograph. But perhaps too because I wanted to photograph one of the objects inside the dark area. Right now it stikes me as eerie but also as pretty. The pink creates a pretty contrast with the black and white children. Especially because they are very composed.
12. The next two objects I photographed because they complemented each other so nicely. A warm summery environment, with the cold of winter. Both showing a daily ritual or something quite normal. 
15. The next one just drew my attention because I could connect to it somehow. It a very common pattern seals with a letter and wood. It fit some expectation I suppose. Yet it was something different, I can't really recall what exactly. For once it's handy that I photographed the text too, often useless. It was an unexpected story.
17. Yes, the next one. I didn't care much for it. Its right next to the letter interesting to me, but I couldn't place it so I ignored it largely. Where it not that someone else went straight for it and ignored the letter that I found special. With an inquisitive mind filled with UCS idea's, I had to find out what was so special about it. I still couldn't determine it. The association of a man/woman things jumped to mind, with me running to seal/letter/broken wood, she running to a pretty flower.
18. Well yes, text on a wall. Didn't read, didn't care. Did however notice that it didn't convey it's message all that well. I've been to a lot of museums, barely ever read these things. But sometimes I did, especially when I had to do an assignment. It's handy material to appear just a little bit well read in essays.
19. Well yeah, these pretty flowers did draw my attention. Unrelated to the previous though, my head was thinking something else. I'm a bad art historian, notice just now that there's something happening underneath too.
20. Yes well. You know why.
22. This one is different though. It looks very sit-able. Perfect height, could use a cushion or two, but if you're try to write while standing it works. The guard didn't agree.
23. The other side. Liked the light hallway, though its lighter on the foto. Got drawn in. Apparently environmental lighting is very important to guide people to certain places. Remembered that this picture was in the set, was actually surprised there's a statue on it too. Ignored it before. 
24. There wasn't much else in the hallway than this. 'What draws your attention" wasn't a hard question here.
25. Well yeah, took the other one to spite Philips. I like orange better.
26. This one is done much better than the ones of the big sponsors.
27. Behind the Nachtwacht. This one drew my attention before knowing anything too. So I took the picture. The fountain is important too. Its cool kids are allowed to play there. Didn't someone else mention this too?
29. The cabinet is cool isn't it? Lots of detail. Could probably say a lot about it, yet none where practical for my thoughts back then. Moved on.
31. Oh noes. The big white thing! I like it though. Fits the space. Fills it. And a great way to hide the lighting.
33. Couldn't help but notice the string.
34. This one got me in the dark. I don't particularity like it right now. Maybe because of the idea of fireplaces appeals to me in general?
36. This one speaks for itself. It was the first time I noticed it though.
38. I wanna fire this thing. Reminds me of Assassins Creed. Though its a bit oversized. 
39. This room is weird. Probably made to show a full room and allow people to walk inside. But its too empty. Something should be happening here. Right now I visualized people appearing like out of the air like some movies do to either bring something to life or take the life out of it. 
40. Its big, in a small space, and thus deserves mention.
42. Here I remembered that guys from the bad psychological audiotour. Great idea wrongly implemented. Was annoyed by this message, didn't know what to make of the space though. Bevrediging. brrr. Satisfaction is less bad though. But I wasn't really looking for both. Should I be mr. philosopher?
45. This one I like a lot. The audiotour was more on track here. Art and Science as one or something? Sounds very DH I realize now. 
46. Whats that handle doing there? Oh yes, there's pretty sculpture on top, but what that handle? I felt like I should know something about that handle, studying art history and all. Didn't though, and hated that. Analyzing the sculpture was less interesting, I wasn't in the mood to analyse elegance and emotion. Some other time.
47. Bit long aren't they? Something to do with that same elegance? The man and young wife? Daughter? is boring though. 
48. Nice end to our journey this one is. Even depicts sort of a journey I notice now. Nice Italic landscape, or not so much, feels like it though. Its not Dutch, thats for sure. But its indeed a bit to mountainy to really be Italy, could be though.
50. No coffee. The bastards. The end. Wrote a bit more. Was too late to photograph the nice squad of Japanese businessmen coming down the stairs though. Those guys felt like some ideal of the museum somehow, men on business appreciating art. Because one should. They didn't learn that much though. But it put them in another mood or something, whatever that might mean. 

--> Thinking of it! In the middle I sat for quite a while in the library, wrote down a lot of stuff down. Didn't make a picture though!  And got handed a pencil, because pens are the devil in there. But it's worth one.
